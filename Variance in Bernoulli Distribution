Variance in Bernoulli Distribution
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 256000
Given a Bernoulli distribution with probability p of success calculate the variance of the distribution.

Input
Complete a function def calculate_variance(p): which receives a single floating-point value p (0 ≤ p ≤ 1), representing the probability of success in the Bernoulli trial as parameter
Output
return a single floating-point number: the variance of the Bernoulli distribution, rounded upto 2 decimal places (using round() function)




def calculate_variance(p):
    return round(p * (1 - p), 2)
