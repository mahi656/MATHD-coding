A university wants to conduct a survey to analyze student satisfaction. There are N students, and they need to select M students for the survey using systematic sampling.

Systematic Sampling Process:

Set a fixed seed for reproducibility using random.seed(42).
Compute K as:  K = ⌊ N / M ⌋
If K ≥ 2:
Randomly select a starting index S within the first K students using random.randint(0, K-1).
Pick every K-th student from the list until exactly M students are selected.
If K < 2:
The starting index S is randomly chosen from 0 ≤ S ≤ N - M using random.randint(0, N-M).
Select the next M consecutive students starting from S.
Input
The first line contains two integers:
N  M
Constraints:
1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 102

The second line contains N space-separated integers, representing the unique student IDs.
Output
Print M integers representing the selected student IDs in order.










import random
random.seed(42)
N, M = map(int, input().split())
students = list(map(int, input().split()))

K = N // M

selected = []

if K >= 2:
    S = random.randint(0, K - 1)

    for i in range(M):
        idx = S + i * K
        selected.append(students[idx])
else:
    S = random.randint(0, N - M)
    selected = students[S:S+M]
print(*selected)
