You are given an array of integers and an integer k,
 which represents the size of the sliding window. Write a program
 to calculate the median of each window of size k as it slides from the beginning to the end of the array. 
The program should output the median for each window as a list of floating-point numbers.





n = int(input())
lis = list(map(int,input().split()))
k = int(input())
medians = []
for i in range(n - k + 1):
    w = sorted(lis[i : i + k])
    if k % 2 == 1:
        medians.append(float(w[k // 2]))
    else:
        medians.append((w[k // 2 - 1] + w[k // 2]) / 2)
for median in medians:
    print(median)
